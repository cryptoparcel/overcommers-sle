        <h2 class="h2">What is a recovery residence?</h2>
        <p>A recovery residence  -  sometimes called a step-down house or transitional home  -  is a safe, sober living environment for people in recovery or reentry. It is <strong>not</strong> a treatment center, detox facility, or medical clinic.</p>
        <p>Recovery residences provide structure, peer support, and accountability while residents rebuild stability: finding employment, reconnecting with family, learning life skills, and developing healthy routines.</p>
        <p>Research consistently shows that the longer someone lives in a supportive, sober community, the better the chances are for lasting recovery. Our home is designed around that principle.</p>

              <h3 class="h3">How it works</h3>
              <p class="muted">All residents are involved in recovery. As a group, residents work together  -  using skills learned in treatment  -  to support each other. This creates accountability, friendships, and dedication to a life of recovery.</p>
